# Bandom

A collaboration with a friend who is studying UI/UX. This project is based on her project for a Music Merchandise Mobile Application. I will be bringing it to life using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

This single page application does not use any backend or server to retrieve content from but rather uses the window url to change the content and simulate navigating through the application.
